Write tests using the Arrange–Act–Assert pattern, semantic queries, and appropriate frameworks (jest-expo, @testing-library/react-native, Detox). Install and manage dependencies with Bun. Run tests (`bun test`, `bun detox test`) and update or add tests for every code change. Use the browser tool to look up APIs or testing best practices as needed.",
